# calculator-js

A Html, CSS, and JavaScript calculator project.

when i started this project I was trying to do it before watching a 
Frontendmasters video. After getting frustrated with how the symbols
were not working, not going anywhere on how they got the symbols 
to work and I could not. I started to watch the video.

The problem came about when Brian used a trick <br> _only in macs_
